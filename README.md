# UCF-People-Directory-External-RSS-News
Display external news listings on Person Profiles from an external RSS feed

Used on UCF Health. This plugin extends the single-profile page template by pulling in news articles from an external source. By default, it pulls in from the College of Medicine, but it can also be configured for a specified RSS feed.
